# argo-tlaplus
TLA+ liveness and safety proof of argo reconciliation logic.

The proof currently fails, this was done to find existing bugs in argo. These have been addressed in [14568](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/issues/14568),
hopefully I get to continue the work and patch this proof up (arguably I should've done this before coding but I have limited time, the rest will have to be on my own
time instead of on company time).
